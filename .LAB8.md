# Managing visions and table expressions
## Task 1:
  Create two views based on the queries formulated in two exercises indicated in the First Vision chapter to be built in the Query Editor, and the second using the View Designer.
 ```sql
 create view view1 as
select distinct s_s.Nume_Student, s_s.Prenume_Student
from rs_s
inner join s_s on rs_s.Id_Student = s_s.Id_Student
where rs_s.Tip_Evaluare = 'Reusita curenta'

go
select * from view1
 ```
 ![image](https://github.com/FluffyK/BDC_LABS/blob/master/BD_LAB8/LAB8-1.1.png)
 
## Task 2:
  Write an example of instructions INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on the created views. Add the relevant comments on the results of these instructions.
```sql
create view view3 as
select Id_Student,Nume_Student, Prenume_Student
from s_s

insert into view3
values (999999,'Nume test', 'Prenume test')

select * from view3 
```

```sql
update view3
set Nume_Student = 'Nume test2'
where Id_Student = 999999
```

```sql
delete from view3 where Nume_Student = 'Nume test2'

select * from view3 
```
 ![image](https://github.com/FluffyK/BDC_LABS/blob/master/BD_LAB8/LAB8-2.3.png)
 

## Task 3:
  Write the SQL statements that would modify the views created (in exercise 1) in such a way that it is not possible to modify or delete the tables that are defined and the views do not support DML operations if the conditions of the WHERE clause are not met.
```sql
alter view view1 with schemabinding as
select distinct studenti.Nume_Student, studenti.Prenume_Student
from studenti.studenti_reusita
inner join studenti.studenti on studenti.studenti_reusita.Id_Student = studenti.studenti.Id_Student
where studenti.studenti_reusita.Tip_Evaluare = 'Reusita curenta'
with check option;
```

```sql
alter view view2 with schemabinding as
select plan_studii.discipline.Disciplina, AVG(cast(studenti.studenti_reusita.Nota as float)) as Media
from studenti.studenti_reusita
inner join plan_studii.discipline on studenti.studenti_reusita.Id_Disciplina = plan_studii.discipline.Id_Disciplina
group by plan_studii.discipline.Disciplina
having AVG(cast(studenti.studenti_reusita.Nota as float)) > 7
with check option;
```

## Task 4:
  Write the test instructions for newly defined properties.

```sql
  alter table studenti.studenti drop column Nume_Student

insert into view1
values('Tester','Tester')

alter table plan_studii.discipline drop column Disciplina

insert into view2
values('Testing', 1)
  ```
  
  ## Task 5:
    To rewrite 2 queries formulated in the exercises in Chapter 4, so that nested interrogations can be rendered in the form of CTE expressions.
    ```sql
    with interogare1 (Id_Student) as(
	 select s_s.Id_Student
     from s_s
     where Nume_Student = 'Orian'
     and Prenume_Student = 'Sergiu')

select distinct ds_ps.Disciplina
from ds_ps, interogare1, rs_s
where rs_s.Id_Student = interogare1.Id_Student
and ds_ps.Id_Disciplina = rs_s.Id_Disciplina
    ```
 ![image](https://github.com/FluffyK/BDC_LABS/blob/master/BD_LAB8/LAB8-5.png)

    ```sql
    --39 Gasiti denumirile disciplinelor la care nu au sustinut examenul, in medie, peste 5% de studenti.
with interogarea39 (Disciplina) as
(select distinct ds_ps.Disciplina
from rs_s
inner join ds_ps on rs_s.Id_Disciplina = ds_ps.Id_Disciplina
inner join s_s on rs_s.Id_Student = s_s.ID_Student
where rs_s.Tip_Evaluare = 'Examen'
group by ds_ps.Disciplina 
having  cast(count ( case when rs_s.Nota<5 then rs_s.Nota else null end) as float) / count(s_s.Nume_Student) < 0.05)

select distinct ds_ps.Disciplina
from ds_ps, interogarea39
where ds_ps.Disciplina = interogarea39.Disciplina
    ```

   ## Task 6:
  a) It is considered an orientated graph, and either the path from the node id = 3 to the node where id = 0 is to be plotted. Make a representation of the oriented graph in the form of the recursive table expression.
 ```sql
                       [4]
                        |
                        v
  [5] -> [0] <- [1] <- [2]
                        ^
                        |
                       [3]
 ```
 
 
 b)Note the UNION ALL instruction of the recursive member, as well as the UNION ALL side of the anchor member.
 create table task6 (
		number1 int primary key,
		number2 int);

insert into task6 
values
(5,0), (4,2), (3,2), (1,0), (2,1), (0, null);

select * from task6;

with task6CTE AS (
		select number1 , number2 from task6
		where number1 = 3 and number2 = 2
		
		union all
		
		select task6.number1, task6.number2 from task6
		inner join task6CTE
		on task6.number1 = task6CTE.number2	
)
SELECT * from task6CTE
